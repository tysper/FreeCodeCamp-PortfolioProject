# FreeCodeCamp-PortfolioProject

Okay, I'm really excited about this project. It is not like I wasn't excited with the other three projects done before. But this time I'm doing my own portfolio. I don't have any project to link to it, but since it will be just the first version of my future portfolio I am not so concerned about it. All I did today was create the basic layout of the webpage and style the first element, and I am already noticing improvement on my skills, and I am really glad that I am being able to do everything I think, the sky is not the limit anymore. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Sorry for the lack of updates haha, I was struggling a lot with the animations and decided to commit just when I finished them, well... I didn't yet, but anyways, I am trying to implement my projects section and also the contact me section, since is a fictional web page I don't have to worry about the data processing because there isn't any. That's it for today.

I finished, and here is a quick summary of what I learnt, or practiced:

<ul>
  <li>Basic Animations and CSS Variables</li>
  <li>Grid Layout</li>
  <li>Flex Layout</li>
  <li>State Selectors</li>
  <li>A little bit of DOM manipulation</li>
  <li>And tried to apply some UX patterns for the first time</li>
</ul>

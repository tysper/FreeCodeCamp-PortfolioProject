# FreeCodeCamp-PortfolioProject

#2021-08-31:
Okay, I'm really excited about this project. It is not like I wasn't excited with the other three projects done before. But this time I'm doing my own portfolio. I don't have any project to link to it, but since it will be just the first version of my future portfolio I am not so concerned about it. All I did today was create the basic layout of the webpage and style the first element, and I am already noticing improvement on my skills, and I am really glad that I am being able to do everything I think, the sky is not the limit anymore. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
